# Dijkstra's algorithm

This repository holds the sourcecode for our assignment for the course Parallel Computing, given at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, in the curriculum software engineering.

For this assignment we wrote a multi threaded implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm. This parallel version is then used to compare the multi threaded version and the single threaded version.
